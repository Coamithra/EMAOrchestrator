# EMAOrchestrator

"Everybody's Making An" Orchestrator — a runbook enforcer that drives Claude Code sessions step-by-step through a CONTRIBUTING.md workflow, so the human doesn't have to babysit adherence.

## Tech Stack

- Electron + React + TypeScript (desktop app)
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (spawns Claude CLI, provides typed events and permission callbacks)
- xterm.js (synthetic terminal display — fed by SDK StreamEvents, not a real PTY)

### CLI Interaction Model (Spike #003)

**Decision:** Use the Claude Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) for all CLI interaction. The SDK's `query()` returns an AsyncGenerator yielding typed `SDKMessage` objects. Permissions are handled via `canUseTool` callback; `AskUserQuestion` arrives as a tool-use event in the message stream. xterm.js renders a synthetic terminal fed by `stream_event` text deltas — no node-pty or real PTY needed.

**Why not PTY?** Detecting permissions and step completion from ANSI-encoded Ink/React TUI output is fragile and breaks on Claude Code updates. The orchestrator needs structured events, not terminal scraping.

### Context Strategy for Multi-Step Prompts (Spike #009)

**Decision:** Use a single long-lived SDK session per agent. Each runbook step is sent as a new prompt within the same conversation — prior-step context is already in Claude's memory. No manual context injection, summarization, or sliding window needed. The SDK's built-in auto-compaction handles the edge case where context approaches the 1M token limit.

**Why not inject context?** With 1M native context on Claude 4.6 (required model family) and SDK auto-compaction as a safety net, manually managing context is unnecessary complexity. A 29-step runbook fits comfortably (~670K tokens including prompts, outputs, and generation room).

## Architecture

Central controller pattern: orchestrator parses the runbook into discrete steps, spawns one Claude CLI session per Trello card (each in its own git worktree), feeds step-specific prompts, detects completion, and advances automatically.

### CLI Driver (`src/main/cli-driver.ts`)

Wraps the Agent SDK's `query()` into an EventEmitter-based service. One `CliDriver` instance per agent session. Key design:

- **Permission pause/resume:** `canUseTool` callback creates a deferred Promise that blocks the SDK generator until `respondToPermission()` is called. This bridges the async callback to the Electron IPC/UI flow.
- **AskUserQuestion:** Detected as `tool_use` blocks with `name === 'AskUserQuestion'` in `SDKAssistantMessage`. Response sent via `query.streamInput()`.
- **Session resumption:** Pass a previous `sessionId` to `CliSessionOptions` to resume a conversation.
- **Shared types:** `src/shared/cli-driver.ts` defines all event/state types for use across main process and renderer.

### Worktree Manager (`src/main/worktree-manager.ts`)

Wraps `git worktree` commands into an async service. Stateless exported functions (same pattern as config-service). One worktree per agent session, created as siblings to the main repo directory.

- **`createWorktree(repoPath, branch)`** — Creates worktree + new branch from main. Reuses branch if it already exists.
- **`listWorktrees(repoPath)`** — Parses `git worktree list --porcelain` into typed `WorktreeInfo[]`.
- **`removeWorktree(repoPath, worktree)`** — Removes worktree by `WorktreeInfo`, prunes, deletes branch.
- **`getOrphanedWorktrees(repoPath)`** — Returns all non-main worktrees (orphans on startup).
- **`cleanupOrphanedWorktrees(repoPath)`** — Removes all orphans and their branches.
- **Shared types:** `src/shared/worktree.ts` defines `WorktreeInfo` for use across main and renderer.

### Step Prompt Generator (`src/main/prompt-generator.ts`)

Pure function that transforms a parsed `RunbookStep` + card context into a Claude prompt string. Called by the orchestration loop to generate the prompt for each step.

- **`generateStepPrompt(context)`** — Takes a `StepPromptContext` and returns a prompt string ready for `CliSessionOptions.prompt`.
- **Position header:** Each prompt starts with "Phase X of Y: PhaseName — Step Z of W" so Claude knows where it is in the workflow.
- **First-step card context:** The Trello card name, description, branch, and worktree path are included only in the very first prompt. Subsequent prompts omit this since the long-lived session already has it (per spike #009).
- **Completion signal:** Each prompt ends with a request for a brief summary, so the orchestrator can log step outcomes.
- **Shared types:** `src/shared/prompt-generator.ts` defines `StepPromptContext` for use across main and renderer.

### Agent State Machine (`src/main/agent-state-machine.ts`)

Tracks a single agent's lifecycle as it works through a parsed runbook. Higher-level than the CliDriver state machine — this orchestrates progress through runbook phases and steps.

- **Dynamic states:** Constructed from the parsed `Runbook` phases. Each phase name becomes a valid state. Fixed states (`idle`, `picking_card`, `error`, `waiting_for_human`, `done`) are always present.
- **Transition enforcement:** Only valid transitions are allowed (e.g., phases must be traversed in order). Invalid transitions throw.
- **Step tracking:** `advanceStep()` marks the current step complete and advances within a phase or auto-transitions to the next phase.
- **Pause/resume:** `setWaitingForHuman()` saves the current phase/step, `resumeFromWaiting()` restores it.
- **Events:** Emits `state:changed`, `step:advanced`, `step:completed`, `phase:completed`, `error`.
- **Shared types:** `src/shared/agent-state.ts` defines `AgentState`, `AgentStateSnapshot`, `AgentStepProgress`, and event types.

### Agent Manager (`src/main/agent-manager.ts`)

Central registry for all active agents. Ties together the Trello card, git worktree, state machine, and CLI session into a single agent concept.

- **`createAgent(card, runbook, repoPath)`** — Creates a worktree (branch derived from card name), instantiates a state machine, registers the agent. Returns the agent ID. Auto-persists.
- **`restoreAgent(persisted)`** — Restores an agent from persisted data. Reconstructs state machine via `AgentStateMachine.restore()`, reuses the original agent ID, skips worktree creation. Used on app startup.
- **`destroyAgent(agentId, repoPath)`** — Removes the worktree, disconnects event forwarding, deletes from registry. Removes persisted state.
- **`getAgent(agentId)`** / **`listAgents()`** — Returns `AgentSnapshot` objects with card info, worktree info, state machine snapshot, session ID, step history, and interruption status.
- **`getStateMachine(agentId)`** — Exposes the state machine for the orchestration loop (#013) to drive.
- **`setSessionId(agentId, sessionId)`** — Links/unlinks a CLI session to an agent.
- **`setStepSummary(agentId, phaseIndex, stepIndex, summary)`** — Sets a summary on a completed step record. Called by the orchestration loop.
- **`setPendingHumanInteraction(agentId, interaction)`** — Sets or clears the pending human interaction. Called by the orchestration loop.
- **Event forwarding:** State machine events are re-emitted as agent-level events (`agent:created`, `agent:state-changed`, `agent:step-advanced`, `agent:step-completed`, `agent:phase-completed`, `agent:error`, `agent:done`, `agent:destroyed`). Step completions also record history entries.
- **Shared types:** `src/shared/agent-manager.ts` defines `CardInfo`, `AgentSnapshot`, and `AgentManagerEvents`.

### Agent Persistence Service (`src/main/agent-persistence-service.ts`)

Persists agent state to `app.getPath('userData')/agents.json` so agents survive app restarts. Follows the config-service pattern (stateless exported functions, JSON, null on error).

- **`loadPersistedAgents()`** — Reads and parses the agents file. Returns `null` on missing file, corrupt JSON, or version mismatch.
- **`savePersistedAgents(store)`** — Writes the full store as pretty-printed JSON.
- **`saveAgent(agent)`** — Upserts a single agent (read-modify-write; safe in single-threaded main process).
- **`removePersistedAgent(agentId)`** — Removes an agent entry from the store.
- **`reconcileAgents(store)`** — On startup, checks each persisted agent's worktree. Missing worktree → stale. Was mid-run → interrupted (sets `interruptedAt`). Otherwise → restored.
- **State machine restore:** `AgentStateMachine.restore(runbook, data)` reconstructs a machine from persisted `StateMachineRestoreData` without emitting events. The runbook is persisted alongside each agent.
- **Save triggers:** `AgentManager` auto-saves on every `state:changed` and `step:completed` event (fire-and-forget).
- **Shared types:** `src/shared/agent-persistence.ts` defines `PersistedAgent`, `PersistedAgentStore`, `StepCompletionRecord`, `PendingHumanInteraction`, `ReconciliationResult`.

### Session Registry (`src/main/session-registry.ts`)

Manages active CliDriver instances and bridges their events to the renderer. One registry for the app.

- **`createSession(options)`** — Creates a CliDriver, wires event forwarding, starts the session. Returns a UUID session ID immediately; the session runs async.
- **`getSession(sessionId)`** — Retrieves a CliDriver by ID (for responding to permissions/questions).
- **`abortAllSessions()`** — Aborts all active sessions (called on app quit).
- **Event forwarding:** All CliDriver events are pushed to the renderer via `webContents.send('cli:event', payload)`. Payload shape: `{ sessionId, event: CliEvent }` (discriminated union).
- Sessions auto-remove from the registry on completion or error.

### IPC Bridge (`src/shared/ipc.ts`)

Central definition of all IPC channel constants and the renderer API type.

- **`IpcChannels`** — String constants for all channels (config, dialog, CLI, worktree, agent persistence). Prevents typos and provides a single source of truth.
- **`CliEvent`** — Discriminated union of all CLI events pushed from main to renderer.
- **`CliEventPayload`** — Wrapper with `sessionId` + `CliEvent` for the `cli:event` channel.
- **`AgentAPI`** — TypeScript interface for the CLI/worktree portion of the preload API.

## Development Workflow

**Every Trello card must follow the runbook in [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).** This is a 6-phase, 29-step process: pick up → research → design → implement → verify → review & ship. No skipping phases. Create a tracker doc before starting.

## Conventions

### Import Aliases

- `@renderer/*` — maps to `src/renderer/src/*` (renderer only)
- `@shared/*` — maps to `src/shared/*` (renderer only; main/preload use relative imports)

### IPC Channels

Named `namespace:action` (e.g., `config:load`, `cli:start`, `worktree:list`). Channel name constants live in `src/shared/ipc.ts` (`IpcChannels`). Request-response channels use `ipcMain.handle` / `ipcRenderer.invoke`. The `cli:event` channel is a one-way push from main to renderer via `webContents.send` for streaming CLI session events. Handlers registered in `src/main/ipc-handlers.ts`, exposed to renderer via the `api` object in `src/preload/index.ts` (typed in `src/preload/index.d.ts`).

### Configuration

App config stored at `app.getPath('userData')/config.json`. Config service in `src/main/config-service.ts`. Schema defined in `src/shared/config.ts`.

## Worktree Layout

The repo is checked out in a `main/` subfolder to support git worktrees:

```
C:\Programming\EMAOrchestrator\
  main/          ← git repo root (main branch)
  feat-xxx/      ← worktree for feature branch
  fix-yyy/       ← worktree for bugfix branch
```
